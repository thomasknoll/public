My public self.
(Or, at least a github version of it.)

I have strong opinions which are loosley held, because I value conversation over dogma, and being influenced over being right.

Please feel free to create issues for discussion.

Feel free to fork this and make it your own public self.

I forked this from Sean Bonner, who forked it from Buster. 
So far, I am just poking around, and haven't edited anything. 
Consider everything here in progress.
